# Relative-velocity
Velocity in Einstein's Theory of Relativity is probably relative as well as mass, time.
If we assume that speed is a relative value, then we can get that Einstein's equations will be true even at speeds exceeding the speed of light.
If the speed of the observer and the object of observation is represented in spherical coordinates, and the differential equation is solved, then a coefficient will appear in front of the ratio of the speed squared to the speed of light squared.
I attach a table with comments and a calculator designed in Python 3. I would be interested to hear the opinion of the community.
